## Style Guidelines

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - ‚ú® `:sparkles:` New feature
  - üêõ `:bug:` Bug fix
  - üìù `:memo:` Documentation
  - üé® `:art:` Code style/formatting
  - ‚ôªÔ∏è `:recycle:` Refactoring
  - ‚ö° `:zap:` Performance improvement
  - ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` Adding tests
  - üîß `:wrench:` Configuration changes

**Examples**:
```bash
git commit -m "‚ú® Add due date filtering to calendar view"
git commit -m "üêõ Fix task deletion bug in CompletedTasksScreen"
git commit -m "‚ôªÔ∏è Refactor TaskProvider for better performance"
git commit -m "üìù Update README with installation instructions"
```

### Code Style

#### Language Requirements

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: All code, comments, and documentation within source files MUST be in English. This includes:
- Variable names
- Function names
- Class names
- Comments
- Documentation strings

Spanish (or other languages) should only be used in:
- User-facing UI text (prepare for i18n)
- Commit messages (if preferred)
- Issue discussions

#### Dart/Flutter Conventions

1. **Follow Official Dart Style Guide**
   - Read: [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart)
   - Use `flutter analyze` to check

2. **Naming Conventions**
   ```dart
   // Classes, enums, typedefs: PascalCase
   class TaskProvider {}
   enum TaskPriority {}
   
   // Variables, functions, parameters: camelCase
   String taskTitle;
   void loadTasks() {}
   
   // Constants: camelCase with const
   const primaryColor = Color(0xFF6C63FF);
   
   // Private members: prefix with underscore
   String _privateField;
   void _privateMethod() {}
   
   // Files: snake_case
   task_list_screen.dart
   ```

3. **Code Formatting**
   ```bash
   # Format all Dart files
   dart format .
   
   # Format specific file
   dart format lib/screens/task_list_screen.dart
   ```

4. **Import Organization**
   ```dart
   // 1. Dart imports
   import 'dart:async';
   
   // 2. Flutter imports
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   
   // 3. Package imports
   import 'package:provider/provider.dart';
   import 'package:hive/hive.dart';
   
   // 4. Relative imports
   import '../models/task.dart';
   import '../providers/task_provider.dart';
   ```

5. **Use Trailing Commas**
   ```dart
   // Good - enables better formatting
   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
     return Container(
       padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16),
       child: Text('Hello'),
     );
   }
   ```

6. **Prefer const Constructors**
   ```dart
   // Good - better performance
   const Text('Static text')
   const SizedBox(height: 16)
   
   // Avoid if const is possible
   Text('Static text')
   ```

7. **Type Annotations**
   ```dart
   // Good - explicit types
   final String taskTitle = 'Buy groceries';
   final List<Task> tasks = [];
   
   // Avoid - unclear types
   final taskTitle = 'Buy groceries';
   final tasks = [];
   ```

### Documentation

1. **Public APIs**: Use `///` documentation comments
   ```dart
   /// Adds a new task to the list and persists it to storage.
   ///
   /// The [task] parameter must have a unique ID.
   /// Throws an exception if storage fails.
   Future<void> addTask(Task task) async {
     // Implementation
   }
   ```

2. **Complex Logic**: Add explaining comments
   ```dart
   // Calculate completion rate as a percentage
   // Handle division by zero for empty task lists
   final completionRate = totalTasks > 0 
       ? (completedTasks / totalTasks * 100).toStringAsFixed(1)
       : "0";
   ```

3. **TODOs**: Use standardized format
   ```dart
   // TODO: Add error handling for network failures
   // FIXME: This causes performance issues with large lists
   // HACK: Temporary workaround until Provider supports async initialization
   ```

## Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/providers/task_provider_test.dart

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# View coverage report (requires lcov)
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
open coverage/html/index.html
```

### Writing Tests

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
   ```dart
   test('addTask should add task to list', () {
     final provider = TaskProvider();
     final task = Task(/* ... */);
     
     provider.addTask(task);
     
     expect(provider.tasks.length, 1);
     expect(provider.tasks.first.id, task.id);
   });
   ```

2. **Widget Tests**: Test UI components
   ```dart
   testWidgets('TaskCard displays task title', (WidgetTester tester) async {
     final task = Task(/* ... */);
     
     await tester.pumpWidget(
       MaterialApp(
         home: TaskCard(task: task),
       ),
     );
     
     expect(find.text(task.title), findsOneWidget);
   });
   ```

3. **Integration Tests**: Test complete flows
   - Located in `integration_test/` directory
   - Test real user scenarios

### Test Coverage Goals

- **Minimum**: 70% code coverage
- **Target**: 80%+ code coverage
- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage (task CRUD operations)
